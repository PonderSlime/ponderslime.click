# In Retrospect
## 2024: A Look Back

Wow! What an eventful year! This past year, I began my journey as a coder. In the past, I had dipped my toes in a bit of coding (nothing really beyond basic web design and python text adventures.) However, this past year I plunged in the deep end of the world of code. I have worked on many projects, ranging from application development, to keyboard firmware. I have learned a lot from these projects.

In the summer of this year, I joined [Hack Club](hackclub.com), a nonprofit organization dedicated to teach teens to code. This summer, they were running a program, called Arcade. The goal of Arcade was to log an hour of working on a project, and get a ticket to spend in the shop. There were many amazing prizes available there, including Yubikeys, Framework laptops, Bambulab Printers, and so much more. The one and only prize that really caught my eye was the
[Meta Quest 3](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3/). At a price of 200 tickets, I knew immediatly that I needed to get it. This marked the start of my journey. Starting with game development, I quickly moved on to web development, creating my first portfolio website.!

Well over 2 months later, I had done it! I finally had reached my goal! Several weeks later it arrived. Although it was my first time ever trying Virtual Reality, it was surprisingly easy to get comfortable with! (I grew up watching videos online with people getting injured.)

With this kind of motivation, it enabled me to achieve far beyond what I thought I was capable of! I now believe that this is my new favorite passtime, other than gaming (of course!).

## What's for 2025?

For the current year, I plan on continue on improving my knowledge of coding, hopefully to eventually create a project worth maintaining! Of course, I have no idea what type of project that would be. Anyways, that is all I have for now!
